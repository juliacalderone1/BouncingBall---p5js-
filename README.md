# BouncingBall-p5js-
Bouncing Ball edit from a p5js editor 
This is a test website to host a p5 project that I just recently learned, mostly from Professor Xiannong Meng. My p5js editor for this repository [https://editor.p5js.org/xmeng/sketches/2d1U_D7rw]. Below is a screenshot of the program. Note the program actually generates a video of the balls bouncing back and forth inside a pre-defined screen frame. 

The website that runs the program is at [https://juliacalderone1.github.io/BouncingBall---p5js-/].
